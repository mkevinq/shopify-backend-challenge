# Shopify Backend Challenge Submission

This is my submission for the Summer 2022 Shopify Backend Intern Challenge!

## About

Some of the notable technologies this submission uses:

- Nest.js
- TypeScript
- MongoDB
- Docker

Please read the instructions below on how to install and use the app. This
submission does NOT have any UI component. This is purely a REST API.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

For ease of getting started, this app can be started using Docker-Compose.

Make sure to install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/),
following the instructions for your respective OS.

Then in a command line:

- Navigate to the root of this repository
- Run `docker-compose up --build`

Now the app and database should both be running!
